An example of this problem is when we have a graph where nodes that share an edge must not be placed in the same group together


there are different of types of things we can say about a particular problem, if all the values / nodes satisfy the constraints of the given problem, that we can say taht that problem is node consistent
so we can start by making node A is node consistent

because we know that B canot be on Monday there are no nodes in this domain that would not ever be life ever for example that no choice arc consistency To make X arc-consistent then I have to look at every possile for Y such tat I have no idea that he said HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA is to make A arc consistent 


arc consistency is when all the vaues in a variable's domain satisy 

in to make we need to renmove elements from X's domanin until every choice for X has a possible choice I can make for Y

we can try for can we choose a variable for A such that but then if we choose wednesday for A then there's no way we can do something like this without being able to do this and that and this and that way and this way and that way the more we get together the merrier we'll be and this friends are my friends and your friends are my friends the more we get together the merrier we'll be and this friends are my friends and your friends are my friends the more we get together the merrier we'll because
